# Project Title
Web scraping


## Problem Statement
An automated data scraping solution is needed to collect up-to-date information about various companies from the RoC (Registrar of Companies) records. The data to be scraped includes the Company Name, CIN (Corporate Identification Number), ROC name, and Company Status. This information is essential for market analysis and competitor tracking.

The web scraping solution should iteratively navigate through the RoC website, accessing individual company profiles, and extract the required data. The scraped data should then be organized and stored in a structured format, such as a database or CSV file. The solution should be capable of handling different company profiles, adapting to changes in website structure, and handling exceptions gracefully.

Additionally, the scraping process should be automated to periodically update the dataset with the latest information. It is critical to ensure that the scraping process complies with legal and ethical guidelines to avoid any potential legal issues.

The goal of this project is to provide a reliable and up-to-date dataset of company information from the RoC records for further analysis and decision-making.
